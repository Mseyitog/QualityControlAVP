In this project, we adapted an existing quality control system for the iPad to the Apple Vision Pro (AVP) The application features several core functionalities, including UI/UX design, ground detection, AR object placement and replacement, inspection of designated points, and the ability to generate reports.

We evaluated the success of our system by investigating and analyzing its performance based on speed and efficiency.
